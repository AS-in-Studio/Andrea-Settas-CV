				<p id="summary">Andrea has completed her Masters in Economics at the University of Cape Town. She currently works as an Analyst at Standard Bank, the largest bank in Africa.

This has led her to teach herself basic HTML and CSS coding in order to fast track the flow of marketing collateral in her current position. She also has experience with data coding softwares. She is a dedicated and focused individual, hard working, and willing to go the extra mile.  Andrea has gained leadership experience at her time at Realfin, training new employees, and at Standard Bank, where she is responsible for the graduates that rotate in her space.
